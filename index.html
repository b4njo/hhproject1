                <p>
                My name is Jan. I have been interested in music since my childhood. When I was about 10 years old I stared to learn playing guitar. During middle school I met some people with whom I started my first band. We played some covers during one of our's school song competitions. <br><br>
                Later on, the band changed some of it's members and played a gig in one school during a WOSP final. <br><br>
                After that we changed members once again and transformed into completely different band, starting to make our own songs. We have released our first single in June of 2018 and soon after that we played the first gig with another band in Tymczasem club in Gdansk. Later we released a 4 song EP and played another gig in Paszcza Lwa Pub and one more in Warsaw in 2Kola Pub. Currently, we are working on our full length album.<br><br>
                We want to expand our band with another guitar player, so if you are interested you can e-mail me from <a href='#6'>this site</a>.<br><br>
